Project Objective: To enter the online bike insurance market in Germany by offering Bike ProteKt's insurance products through Check 24, the largest online comparison portal in the country, and targeting different customer segments.
Background: Bike ProteKt plans to start by conducting a competitor analysis on Check 24 in order to identify the right competitor and develop a competitive product and pricing strategy for all customer segments. This analysis will provide insights into pricing trends and distribution in different locations, as well as the ratings logic used by Check 24 to categorize products into three segments: Cheap, Price-performance recommendation, and performance recommendation, which represent different customer segments.
Activity: Conduct analysis to determine the ideal price and location targeting for all three customer segments, decide whether to focus on e-bike or normal bike customers, and perform any other necessary analysis to make informed decisions.
